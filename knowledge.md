### :information_source:  Blockchain Recap

There are two place which "store" data in Hyperledger Fabric (the underlying blockchain infrastructure used by Composer):

    * the ledger
    * the state database ('World state')

The ledger is the actual **"blockchain"**. It is a file-based ledger which stores serialized blocks. Each block has one or more transactions. Each transaction contains a 'read-write set' which modifies one or more key/value pairs. The ledger is the definitive source of data and is immutable.

The **state database** (or 'World State') holds the last known committed value for any given key - an indexed view into the chain’s transaction log. It is populated when each peer validates and commits a transaction. The state database can always be rebuilt from re-processing the ledger (ie replaying the transactions that led to that state). There are currently two options for the state database: an embedded LevelDB or an external CouchDB.

As an aside, if you are familiar with Hyperledger Fabric 'channels', there is a separate ledger for each channel.

The chain is a transaction log, structured as hash-linked blocks, where each block contains a sequence of _N_ transactions. The block header includes a hash of the block’s transactions, as well as a hash of the prior block’s header. In this way, all transactions on the ledger are sequenced and cryptographically linked together.

The state database is simply an indexed view into the chain’s transaction log, it can therefore be regenerated from the chain at any time.

### :information_source:  Business Networks - themes, contexts

The themes or questions below, reflect different elements of themes of 'modus operandi' of a business network. So, channels and privacy and business networks, is a theme - and so on:


| Message/Issue encountered | Resolution 
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
| what a user can access, its rights: why divide a network into different channels, how are ACLs applied? |Answer: channels provide privacy, between organisations (say 2 organisations of _n_) on the same blockchain network. You can have many channels, and some organisations may not be allowed to join that channel (eg. two-party channel excludes a third) but still be part of the same 'greater' blockchain network. Access Conrol rules (ACLs) work within the realms of a business network, controlling participants, asset access, transactions types allowed etc, what CRUD operations, etc etc - the business network (with its ACL rules) are deployed to a channel - there is a one-to-one mapping between a ledger and a channel in Fabric 1.x. Usually an example of ACLs being used - is restricting either Org's participants (ie as identified in the business network) according to what each Org deems to be allowed to do/see on the ledger, that they both have access to (on the channel) - they agree the rules, like they would agree the 'constitution' of a club, when they set it up (or tweak later on). ACLs are in the 'runtime' of the business network - so filtering if you like. Each channel can have more than one deployed business network on that channel - so the scenario where the same '2' orgs (etc) are running different kinds of business networks, and can share the same channel and therefore ledger - but in essence, the views/updates into that ledger are through the interaction in the relevant business network, from where the source transactors can be identified and assets, participants, transactions etc are collated in an orderly, organised fashion through registries (specific to that business network).

### :information_source:  Business Network Cards

jump to [**Review card errors / resolutions**](#cardfaq) to see more on current **Core* card errors & resolutions

jump to [**Review Card APIS issues / resolutions**](#cardapis) to see more on card-related **JS API** errors & resolutions


A Business Network Card provides the means for a user (such as an application user or identity in Playground) to connect to a Composer business network which runs in its own runtime container. It is only possible to access a Composer business network through a valid Business Network Card. It consists of a connection profile, some metadata for the identity using it, and ultimately, a set of credentials (certificate/private key). An identity (linked to a participant in Composer) can have one or more cards, to connect to one or more business networks.

The benefits are that once you export a card, it is a portable card. So it can be issued to a new user or given to someone (usually that real identity in that Organisation) to then connect and transact on business network, on the blockchain network. Yes, of course - they should be handled with care. We recommend that you only send identity cards that have been encrypted. See separate note on use of cards with a multi-user REST server environment.


**Best practices with cards:**

* If you issue an identity in Playground (connected to a Fabric): 
    1. Add it to your wallet (it only has an enroll id / one-time secret at this point)
    2. Connect to the business network (to download its certificate/key in exchange for the one-time secret) then (from 'My Business Networks' in Playground):
    3. Export it using the export icon on the identity/card in question.
    
* If you [issue an identity](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/reference/composer.identity.issue.html) from the CLI or via JS APIs (connected to a Fabric): eg. `  composer identity issue -c admin@mynetwork -f JonDoe.card -u jdoe1 -a "resource:net.acme.biz.Person#jondoe1@biznet.org"` where `mynetwork` is the business network name and `net.acme.biz` is the namespace in the model.
    1. Initially, the .card file only has an enroll id / one-time secret at this point - so you need to import it
    2. From the CLI, import (example): `composer card import --file JonDoe.card`
    3. Use it (to download certificate/key to the local wallet and now primed with credentials)  - example is to do a `composer network ping -c JonDoe.card`
    4. Export it ie *from the Composer credentials vault* using `composer card export -f JDoeExport.card --name jdoe1@mynetwork`  
    5. Now as an identity administrator, you can securely share this exported .card file with the real user, so they can interact with the `mynetwork` business network from (say) their Node application, or authenticated via REST in a browser (once imported to their local wallet) etc and so on.
    6. Suggest to remove/delete the 'old' `JonDoe.card` file because it is now redundant (because we have the portable .card file,  complete with credentials)

In general:

* If you create a card on disk (eg exported unused from Playground, using the CLI, or the APIs) - the file will contain the single-use enrol id/secret and needs to be exchanged for a certificate from the CA server. 
   1. Import the card (.card file) (either through Playground - choose file, or via CLI import command or APIs) into your Composer wallet
   2. Either connect to it (eg. in Playground, via APIs) or use `composer ping` (eg. via CLI) to ping it using the imported card name eg `composer ping -c donald@tutorial-network`
   3. Export the card *from the Composer credentials vault* to a .card file (via Playground, CLI or APIs) - and replace the original .card file (it has redundant enrol info now). That new .card file can now be given to a designated user (eg on another system). Obviously, you may wish to keep a 'template' .card file elsewhere if you wish to retain that for future use.
   
   That's it.

* The  CLI command `composer card list --name user4@trade-network` command displays details of a named card, and its state - ie a boolean value at the bottom stating whether **Credentials Set** or **Credentials Not Set** - this indicates whether the Certificates have been downloaded and stored in the wallet (or not - in which case, the id is not yet enrolled with the CA)



Important: If you export a Business Network Card that **has never been used** (eg in Playground for example), it will still just contain the one-time enrollment ID and enrollment secret only. The first time that exported card gets used, wherever that is -  it connects with the one-time secret and the identity's certificate/key combo is downloaded to that user's local wallet. This is a perfectly normal scenario (as shown above).  If you (or the destined user) plan on using that card elsewhere (eg another system) - You **must export** this card, to a new .card file, so it can then be shared with the destined identity (that was registered with the CA earlier). Don't re-use the 'original .card file (just remove it) - otherwise re-using the 'old' will just register a different identity each time (because it still has an enrol id remember) and this can be a cause of major pain for many (this is how security, identity and certificates work, its not a 'Composer' thing).

More technical:

Together, both `cards` and `client-data` directories in `$HOME/.composer` are an integral part of the whole wallet structure in the card store (credentials vault). `client-data` is where the hlfv1 composer connector will store the identity credentials for a card (either by importing an existing card or when it has enrolled an identity, eg. connect to the business network). So a card `admin@tutorial-network` it will have the usual client crypto file artifacts such as : 'admin' xx-priv, xx-pub . Meanwhile,an imported card get persisted to the `cards` subdirectory. If that card contains only the initial enrollment secret, on 'first use' it will retrieve the cert/key combo from the CA server and those get stored in`client-data`. If the card in the walet is subsequently exported then the certificate/key gets retrieved from `client-data` too and added to the exported card. You should not in any way change anything manually under the `$HOME/.composer` directory PLEASE NOTE !

If you are moving from an 'older' version (say you had once installed a Composer release prior to v0.15.0) make sure you remove any directory called`.composer-credentials` directory under your $HOME directory (for whatever user being used) - it is not used by Composer and removing it removes potential confusion when troubleshooting.

#### What is the PeerAdmin Card provided with the Dev environment ?

PeerAdmin card (imported to the wallet/credentials store during the `createPeerAdminCard.sh` step), has 2 roles in our dev fabric server setup. It has the authority to install chaincode onto the peer and it has the authority to instantiate chaincode onto the channel. It's name 'PeerAdmin' is a little confusing. Also in a real world scenario it's highly unlikely you would have a AdminCard for each Peer. What is more likely is you would have a PeerAdmin card for each organisation so you can install chaincode on all Peers in that organisaton. There would then be a separate ChannelAdmin card so that within the Consortium the Composer business network can be started.

#### What is the 'NetworkAdmin' card created in Composer tutorials using the Dev environment (per the Docs site) ?

The Network Admin card is a card, once imported, that provides access to the deployed business network (eg. deployed by PeerAdmin above). The default is that the credentials you supply either by the flags -A/-S or -A/-C (when you deploy or start a business network) is then bound to an instance of the in-built NetworkAdmin Participant type, with a name usually the same as that specified in the -A part. To access a business network as a 'normal' non-admin user,  you have to use an identity that is mapped to a regular participant created as a resource/record in your business network namespace.

#### Why can't I use PeerAdmin to do transactions, why can't he be a Network Admin too ? 

Firstly, its to do with 'roles' that FABRIC lays down - so **admin** (in the sample Fabric network) is is bound as a network admin in the Composer system registry,  with authority to issue identities via Fabric CA. The **PeerAdmin** (who is not bound as a network admin in the registry) that you use is bootstrapped for the Dev Fabric environment(ie  PeerAdmin a label for for someone that has 'PeerAdmin' authority (to deploy chaincode) in Fabric in the Development environment setup (in reality, someone setting up their own blockchain network infrastructure, would create their own distinct identities via their CA and give them the right Fabric roles. I suggest to read this to understand a bit more than I've paraphrased here -> https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/business-network/bnd-deploy.html - suffice to say,  that when a business network card is created for a business network, its good practice to have a clear demarcation for someone to deploy chaincode as opposed to doing admin / operational / identity issuance tasks on the network - in that Org etc. Neither of those 'users' would be considered 'day to day business transactors' (creating transactions) - those activities would be done by other participants/consumers of the business network,  for whom the business network was set up - cross-org transactions. For which you would issue identities (each Org, that is) and create business network cards, as it includes their issued blockchain identity etc etc)

### Card Errors / Resolutions

| Message/Issue encountered | Resolution 
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
|HSM related issues | If you want to HSM,  enable all the identities used by your fabric network (and specifically fabric-network here, not your composer business network) then you would have to find a way to recreate all the identities used to setup the fabric utilising your HSM, that is a fabric setup requirement and so you would need to ask on the fabric channels. If you want to then HSM manage the identities used by the composer business network you would need to use a connection profile with HSM enabled to perform the various identity management requests available in composer. There are a couple of important points to note. CLI commands that create cards will take the connection profile of the card currently being used to perform the request. If that card is not HSM enabled, then the newly created card will also have a connection profile that isn't HSM enabled. This means having a mixed environment of non HSM and HSM enabled identities requires more work in order to allow that kind of environment and isn't something that is documented. The HSM support assumes that all identities used both for fabric interaction and business network interaction are all HSM managed. HSM capability in Composer is really only for an everything is HSM managed environment, ie your fabric identities are HSM managed. It is possible to have a mixed environment but that requires much more work to do, but really doesn't make sense to have some identities HSM managed and some not managed. To create an HSM managed yperledger Fabric network is something you would have to build yourself. I am not aware of any tutorial (presently) on the Hyperledger Fabric docs page that would tell you how to do this so you would have to work this out based on their existing tutorials and understanding the various commands for building a fabric.

### :information_source:  Client API Usage and Guidelines

Below are some generic or specific questions on using client-side JS APIs

| Message encountered | Resolution 
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
|AutoGenerate ID, Auto-Increment inside a TP issues | you should generate the autoincrement ID client-side (custom generated, or using UUIDs for example - using uuid on the client side and pass it in as part of the TP payload) and pass that into the Composer APIs. The only safe, deterministic way to "generate" an ID on the 'Blockchain' side in a Composer transaction processor function is to use the transaction ID. You should not generate an autoincrement id within a transaction processor doing so could be non-deterministic and the transaction would be rejected because the results of the transaction processor running on different peers would not match.

| Error: REQUEST_TIMEOUT  | As part of the Composer Network Start, Fabric tries to build a new chaincode Container which includes `npm install` commands. A **`REQUEST_TIMEOUT`** can occur with the failure to build the Chaincode containers for all peers within the default timeout period of 5 mins through lack of system resources or poor network connections.This can be a problem for the Multi-Org tutorial, but also for single peer installs. If you are using our simple Hyperledger Composer development server environment from composer-tools github repo, then you can add the following to the peer definition to see if it addresses the problem:
| continued .... | CORE_CHAINCODE_STARTUPTIMEOUT=1200s in the file ~/fabric-tools/fabric-scripts/hlfv11/composer/docker-compose.yml eg, the above is a snippet from the peer definition. You would then have to do a `docker-compose stop` - then `docker-compose start` from that directory location to take effect. If you are using a more complex Fabric you will need to find the docker-compose files used to configure your Fabric and modify those. After modifying a docker-compose file it will be necessary to run the `startFabric.sh` script and re-run the `composer network install` command, and then finally the `composer network start` command.

| Error: 2 UNKNOWN: error starting container: Failed to generate platform-specific docker build:  | As part of the Composer Network Start, Fabric tries to build a new chaincode Container which includes `npm install` commands.  This error is usually a Failure to build the container because of an underlying npm issue. 
| continued .... | Using `docker logs <PEER Container Name>` will show if there are npm errors. Generally npm Warnings can be ignored - but serious errors such as "Error: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN nodejs.org:443" need to be resolved. The most common cause of the error is a corporate proxy or firewall preventing access outbound. More specifically, the need to include an npmrcFile as part of the `composer network start` sequence. These npm errors need to be fixed before a chaincode container can be successfully built.  You may recognise the problem and be immediately able to fix, but if not it is advisable to create a temporary container based on the same image that Composer uses.  Having a dedicated test container will be a fast way to identify and solve your local npm issues.  The following commands may help:
|continued .... | Create a test container: `docker run -it --name npmtest --network composer_default  --entrypoint "/bin/sh" hyperledger/composer-cli` | When the container starts, install 'a' (a small npm package)    `npm install -g a`

More info on the kinds of on migrating data from Playground, Fabric etc - best practices

| Message encountered | Resolution 
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
| I've lost my data in Playground | see below
| How to migrate existing data from blockchain - | see below
| How to save my data in Playground/Fabric? |  If you add new fields to a Participant you are correct : you can no longer see the data in Playground (but the record with that participant id or asset ID etc, still exists on the ledger). If you remove the field from the model - you can see the data again. If you add the new field but with 'optional' after the field in the model, you will see the original data (again) - that might be all you need to solve your short-term issue. Going beyond that, it is easy to extract the data to JSON files using the REST APIs (https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/integrating/getting-started-rest-api.html ). You can easily extract the JSON data from the registry in question to a text file - then change it to match your new model etc etc if you wish. I would think writing a simple to extract the data (eg using curl REST API GET) and re-adding (a REST API POST) with the new fields/data for relevant participants/assets might be a way forward if you wish to retain data going forward. Then you can see it in Playground change / add there etc etc.
|Migrate using the REST Server? | 1. Execute a GET on each of the registries (Asset Types and Participant Types), and put these in text files 2. Use a text editor to do 'global' search and replace to add your new fields  3. Deploy new extended business network  4. Execute a POST for each of the registries using the text files as the JSON input. 
|Migrate using Node-Red | see the Node RED to export / then import the data - We have a tutorial that shows how to import: https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/tutorials/nodered-tutorial.html

| Message encountered | Resolution 
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
| General Endorsement Troubleshooting | The main caveat to pass on to clients seeking assistance is to remind them that troubleshooting endorsement policy is fundamentally a Hyperledger Fabric issue (may best be asked on #fabric channel on Rocketchat or they can review more on endorsement at the [Fabric docs site](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/endorsement-policies.html)) - this is because Composer merely passes on the endorsement policy metadata. Important to note that endorsement policies used for a Composer business network must be in the JSON format, as used by the Hyperledger Fabric Node.js SDK (the examples in doc link above will not be in JSON format FYI).
| ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE error seen in Multi-Org tutorial (2 orgs) .. `compareProposalResponseResults - read/writes result sets do not match index=1` |Received proposals back from 2 or more peers, but at least 1 of the proposal results is different from the others. If for example an endorsement policy has stated that all the peers must endorse then it also means that all the peers must agree on the same results. If they don't -  you get an endorsement policy failure ;  because at least 1 peer doesn't agree and so you cannot satisfy the endorsement policy, hence the message.

### :information_source:  Fabric Issues relating to your Dev Environment setup

The following are a selection of answers, to help understand what you may be encountering. Check also [Runtime Install errors](#runtime-install) for runtime issues.


| Message encountered | Resolution 
| :---------------------- | :----------------------- 
| '**Error: No valid responses from any peers**'  | **The Fabric is Not Started** - The error has been seen when a Developer's Fabric has not been started (or restarted).  A simple check is the command `docker ps` that will show if the Fabric Containers are running. If the Fabric is not running either run the `startFabric.sh` script under **fabric-tools** or see the entry in this Wiki for Restarting Development Fabric. 
| **Starting/Stopping Dev Environment Impact / How to retain Docker container state**  | The `startFabric.sh` under **fabric-tools** does more than just start the Fabric - it removes existing Fabric Containers and recreates new Containers from the Docker Images.  The impact of this is that you lose all your data and your Business Network from the Fabric.  All Business Network Cards except PeerAdmin@hlfv1 are now useless. If you want to stop and start your Fabric after you have created it, retaining your Business Network and data follow these commands:  * Change to the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is (e.g. `/home/_\<user\>_/fabric-tools/fabric-scripts/hlfv1/composer` ) * Run `docker-compose stop` to stop the Fabric Containers   * Run `docker-compose start` to restart from where you left off with the current state of your Fabric.  
| '**The Fabric is not accessible**' | The error can be seen when the Business Network Card uses IP Names or Addresses for Docker Containers that are not resolveable or accessible.   For instance a Card my refer to Fabric Containers on localhost which work on a Developer's machine, but won't work if a card is passed to another person.  Examine the addresses in the connection.json file to see if they can be reached.  The connection.json file will be located in a folder similar to this example: `/home/_<user\>_/.composer/cards/admin@tutorial-network` 
|MVCC_READ_CONFLICT error | MVCC_READ_CONFLICT` is a response from the Fabric network. Stackoverflow for example has info about the meaning, eg https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45347439/mvcc-read-conflict-when-submitting-multiple-transactions-concurrently

<a name="filters"></a>


### :information_source:  Filters (Loopback)

The syntax examples below are Loopback Filter syntax FYI

Examples of stringified JSON Filters 

| Filter Type  | Example
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
| Two condition 'and' filter | `{ "where":{ "and":[ { "isAccepted":true }, { "isClosed":false }] } }`
| Three condition 'and' filter | ` { "where":{ "and":[ { "isAccepted":true }, { "isClosed":false }, { "providertype":"Broker"} ] } } `

Examples of non-stringified JSON Filters 

| Filter Type  | Example
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
| Three Condition 'and' filter | `[where][and][0][isAccepted]=1&filter[where][and][1][isClosed]=0&filter[where][and][2][providerType]=Broker"" `

eg. `curl -g -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/Commodity?filter[where][and][0][isAccepted]=1&filter[where][and][1][isClosed]=0&filter[where][and][2][providerType]=Broker"" `

Example of Filter resolve: (meaning: Search on a modeled asset and resolve the data for the related model (eg. Commodity owner below)

| Filter goal  | Example
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
| resolve all relationships | `{"include":"resolve"}`
| resolve specific an asset relationship | `{"where":{"asset_id":"resource:org.acme.biznet.Commodity#ABC"}, "include":"resolve"}`
| resolve specific asset by id | `{"where":{"shipmentId":1000}, "include":"resolve"}`
| resolve 'between' ascii sorted - Traders between 1 and 10  | `{"where":{"owner":{"between": ["resource:org.acme.trading.Trader#TRADER1","resource:org.acme.trading.Trader#TRADER10"]}}, "include":"resolve"}`

### :information_source:  Historian Questions


jump to [**Historian Queries**](#historianqueries) for more info on Historian related queries or examples


Some typical examples of historian related questions below:

| Message Encountered / Question  | Answer/Resolution
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
| Does Historian prevent 'false' / wrong transactions? | Historian records what was consensually agreed as the 'truth' - the whole point of the blockchain is to detect tampering or the 'poison' in the network ?? If ledger data had been altered or corrupted on a peer during a transaction, then the transaction results would be inconsistent across endorsing peers, the 'bad' peer will be found out, and the application client can throw out the results from the bad peer before submitting the transaction for ordering/commit. If client application tries to submit a transaction with inconsistent endorsement regardless, this will be detected and the transaction will be invalidated by all peers at commit time.If there is doubt about state database integrity on a specific peer, the state database can be dropped and it will automatically get regenerated from the chain source of truth. If there is doubt about the chain integrity itself, then the peer itself will need to be rebuilt and the chain will be state transferred

### :information_source:  Historian Queries - common asks

Some typical examples of historian queries asked are below (obviously you would build this query per the docs) :

| Query goal / aim  | Example
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
| SELECT ALL | `SELECT org.hyperledger.composer.system.HistorianRecord `
| Select Transaction Type | ` SELECT org.hyperledger.composer.system.HistorianRecord  WHERE (transactionType == 'myTranType' `
| Select Transaction Class | `SELECT org.acme.biznet.PaymentTxn WHERE (mypaymentID == '001' `     ie just one transaction class
| with Order By  | `SELECT org.hyperledger.composer.system.HistorianRecord  WHERE (transactionType == 'myTranType') ORDER BY [transactionTimestamp DESC] `
| Select by Txn ID | SELECT org.hyperledger.composer.system.HistorianRecord WHERE (transactionId==_$trxID) 
|Find the History of a particular Asset(1/2) | we have a current issue open for Historian to showhistory of changes/ deltas for a particular asset - https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/issues/2458 As a workaround you can do the following - so for sample network `trade-network`
|Find History ...Asset ...(2/2) | `query selectTransaction{ description: "choose a specific commodity " statement: SELECT org.acme.biznet.Trade WHERE (commodity  == _$commodity ) }` finds all transactions of transaction `Trade` (that are used to update an asset) for a particular asset id - can also add a date range if need be - so that's a query showing what changed - obviously there is an initial AddAsset transaction (see more on that here -> chat.hyperledger.org/channel/composer?msg=eZK96GouZhbAzniB2 - So once you've updated your network to recognise the newly added query defined in your `queries.qry` and the named query is defined in your .cto model file you can try it out . The other way is to use Filters (as opposed to queries):on your REST client - so use a filter using `{"where":{"commodity":"resource:org.acme.biznet.Commodity#ABC"}, "include":"resolve"} `.. so find all transactions for asset with tradingSymbol (ID field) of 'ABC' - ie a relationship - and I can resolve the transaction and the particular asset it relates to. In this case it was 1 transaction (could be more) showing changes and I can see the transaction (with resolved) detail, for that asset. See other link I sent you above `targetRegistry` - the example shown is 'AddAsset' - transactions are ordinarily the 'update' but in any case the targetRegistries for Update/Delete would be UpdateAsset and RemoveAsset respectively

| Message encountered | Resolution

|Multi-stage [transaction/smart-contract related] approval with Composer ? | As opposed to multiple endorsement at a Fabric level. Example: each of the 3 participants (3 of n) submit a transaction, approving as part of a multi-stage approval. You then have 3 approvals recorded on the blockchain for the same asset id. The last approver's transaction (based on a read of a count field in the asset record in the assetRegistry) - on submitting the 3rd approval - updates the asset and resets the count to 0 (maybe also updates its approval status to 'APPROVED' etc) and immediately emits an APPROVED event back to your calling application with the asset ID and status to proceed to the next stage of your lifecycle. https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/business-network/publishing-events.html . The event would only be emitted (on approval 3) if that update was successful.
| Modeling/Storing images/PDFs/media | You can use String and base64 encode it - as a field in an Asset for example, and have responsibility for decoding later etc etc But would you want to store it on the blockchain? You decide of course.  If you wanted to you could see an SO thread here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21878404/how-can-i-convert-mp3-file-to-base64-encoded-string/23665155 or here see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47751609/how-to-deal-with-forms-images-videos-of-an-asset-in-hyperledger-composer .  Storing images, scans, audio files is not a 'best practice' - rather, a cryptographic hash of it (referenced off-chain) is verifiable proof that the source is the exact image/media file that was 'hashed' at the time the 'transaction' was recorded on the blockchain and link out of the chain, to a URL containing the verifiable source (and comparable hash). Examples may be: doctor/patient audio discussions (not least the privacy elements!) & consultation recordings, PDFs, mp3s, image files. Another issue is that an encoded base64 image string (if you chose to encode the media/image file that is) will also need to be transmitted to the other peers participating in consensus and written to their copy of the master ledger. It is therefore more efficient, to only share the hash (not the base64 encoded contents with each peer).

| Is CouchDB the default database for Composer ? Also, can we swap CouchDB for a different database? | LevelDB is the default database for Hyperledger Fabric for the World State database. Composer uses whatever State Database is defined for the Fabric it is connecting to. CouchDB is Optional for Fabric and gets started in a separate docker container. Queries are very limited for Composer when LevelDB is used - so the Dev Fabric Composer uses has a CouchDB. The Fabric documentation and #Fabric channel will know if there are other options for the State database.

| Creating a blockchian network, multi-Org  - across separate physical/virtual machines | see this tutorial examples here -> https://medium.com/@wahabjawed/hyperledger-fabric-on-multiple-hosts-a33b08ef24f . There are 3 main things to consider.  1) - Initial setup and using the same generated Crypto material and sharing public keys needed for business network cards on 'each other's nodes'. 2) - Networking - making sure the containers on the **separate** machines know the addresses of the other docker containers (on each machine) and can connect. Network planning and testing is required at the beginning. 3) Create/modify the Fabric startup scripts (eg, BYFN scripts, yamls) for multihost. General advice would be to **first** try the MultiOrg tutorial on a single machine with sufficient resource. Using a MultiOrg setup on different machines, can have a few pitfalls, best to avoid. How have you set up the machines? Are you sharing the Crypto material between them? ie if you generated 2 sets of Crypto material that will be a problem. Also how are you managing addressing, resolution/lookup and communication between your 2 physical/virtual machines? These issues are that must be addressed in advance.
| Creating a blockchain network, single Org - across multiple machines (external tutorial based on 0.16.x) | See https://discourse.skcript.com/t/setting-up-a-blockchain-business-network-with-hyperledger-fabric-composer-running-in-multiple-physical-machine/602 for example on adding a peer on a separate machine. Here are some pointers if you have issues: 1) Remember your containers can't 'see' each other properly across the physical machines (docker can't do it for you!) unless you provide some means of resolution (like hosts files). You may also find (say) that if you have 2 peers running on one machine and another (one, set of) peer(s) on the other machine are trying to hit on the same Port (on that machine). Perhaps trying a Fabric setup - with just 1 peer on each machine might be a good place to start? Then build from there. 2) From a Composer perspective the key is the connection.json file (as part of the business network card you build) that you use to connect to your Fabric runtime (eg peers etc). (If you are using TLS then you need to sort out certificates and hostnames too.) 3) From a Fabric perspective, ALL your Peer containers and your orderer on your Physical machines /VMs need to have connectivity/resolution between each other. You will need to plan out the Address resolution and Routing, with port forwarding too. Depending on the way you have set up your machines you may find that the "extra_hosts:" feature of Docker Compose is useful. (I think that the Peers try to 'chat' with each other on the same port number so you will need to manage any conflicts.) 4) Before putting Composer on top of your custom Fabric we generally advise people to install the Fabric Marbles Sample demo on all their peers -> to prove Fabric is working as expected before adding Composer. If you have problems with Fabric Marbles - please check the #fabric channel. 5) At this time we don't have a Multi-Machine tutorial, but one of the members of the channel has a doc for a Single Org on 2 machines that you can read more on here . Hope this helps.

Error: Failed to load connector module "composer-connector-hlfv1" for connection type "hlfv1". | Often see this after running `./createPeerAdminCard.sh` for example. RESOLUTION: 1) check Node version is a [**supported version**](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/installing/installing-prereqs.html)  from our docs 2) If a wrong version - a) uninstall node - see instructions on Stack Overflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11177954/how-do-i-completely-uninstall-node-js-and-reinstall-from-beginning-mac-os-x) then b) install nvm c) install correct node version using NVM you installed earlier d) uninstall the composer modules using `npm uninstall -g composer-cli` etc etc  e) do a teardown (from fabric-tools then f) `rm -rf $HOME/.composer` (dot-composer) to remove old business network cards then g) decide if you're installing 0.16.x or 0.18.x Composer - you will need to set the Fabric version ; export FABRIC_VERSION=hlfv11 if (0.18.x or indeed older 0.17.x) - so that it pulls the correct Fabric runtime docker containers g) re-install composer using npm install  (again, choose 0.16.x or 0.18.x - the latter requires specific `@next` tag upon install of modules - see [release info](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/releases) -g composer-cli etc etc - as per 'Step 1' of the Install docs page. We recommend that you use nvm to manage your node install thereafter and do everything under your current user, ie don't use sudo for Composer installs specifically - just read the install docs for guidance.

### :information_source:  Production-Related Questions

The following are a selection of answers, to help understand what you may be encountering:

| Message encountered | Resolution 
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
|Is it safe to use Composer in Production? | Hyperledger Composer is currently in pre-release with new releases most weeks and often with breaking changes - this means that at this time most people would find this too risky for production. Looking forward, a production version of Composer requires Hyperledger Fabric 1.1 - there is currently a release candidate for this so I would think we are not too far away from a Fabric 1.1 release. I'm not aware of any published date for a 1.0 production release of Composer. This post form the Mailing List for Composer explains the production issue: https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-composer/2017-November/000044.html . Also keep an eye on the regular releases for latest information: https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/releases and Issues: https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/issues - and finally the main Hyperledger site: https://www.hyperledger.org/
| Is Composer production capable ? Isn't it just a Dev framework for prototyping? |Indeed, Hyperledger Composer is a development framework but it is also a runtime abstraction layer for executing smart contracts in which a business network (eg. say 'trade settlement'  or 'supply chain finance' etc etc) is deployed as a runtime smart contract, on the blockchain, between the parties involved, and upon which all have agreed the terms (what the model is, the data elements, the security, the access control, how identities are issued, , the contract terms blah blah). Sure, Composer makes it easier to develop blockchain applications and smart contracts - that's one of its aims, as well as adding in all of the consistency, validation or gruntwork you would otherwise have to do as an application developer (you can get an insight into that here -> https://blog.selman.org/2017/07/08/getting-started-with-blockchain-development where Fabric and Composer are compared. That is the development perspective but also the runtime perspective as I've alluded to above. Hyperledger Composer currently uses Hyperledger Fabric as the underlying 'blockchain infrastructure' or underlying blockchain technology, put simply. This can be configured in many ways in a secure Cloud environent etc etc. Composer is aimed at production deployment/scalability - ultimately, you'll be deploying business networks and smart contract transaction logic (written in a mainstream app dev language so app developers don't need specialist language skills) that will execute on the blockchain network (wherever that is deployed, however configured, privacy etc) that you (as an organisation etc) will configure (ie between the parties involved). Composer delivers native Node.js support with Composer (since v0.17.x preview release in fact), that runs with Fabric v1.1 (alpha version) and that version of Fabric will be available as a GA production ready release in the near future (obviously Fabric v1.0.x release is already out there).Furthermore, your Composer's Javascript language and engine can call the native Fabric APIs (to pull in all of the functionality that offers inside Composer contract logic)  So Composer is both the development framework, the modeler and the runtime execution on the blockchain ; as well as all managing all the other important aspects of working with that business network, such as managing identity,access control, participation, API support and connectivity elements essential to working with/transacting on a blockchain network. Hope this helps.

|[eventhub_producer] Chat -> ERRO 37f error during Chat, stopping handler: rpc error: code = Canceled desc = context canceled | The problem you are seeing is is likely because the identity you are using to try to install the runtime onto a peer is not authorised to do so. Unfortunately the logs info from Fabric don't indicate this . If you are using the Composer development server then it creates an identity for you called PeerAdmin which you should use to deploy business networks. If you are using your own fabric then you need to look into how to import crypto material when building a peer administrator card and for which it has the PeerAdmin role to do so.

The following are a selection of answers, to help understand what you may be encountering:

| Message encountered | Resolution 
| :---------------------- | :-----------------------
| Timestamps in transactions - how to get the same timestamp across all peers | The timestamp is client side generated pls note - so will be the same across all endorsing peers. Client application don't actually generate the timestamp, it is generated by Composer so the format will be consistent - the timestamp  represents when a  transaction is submitted, not committed.
| Transaction rollback - errors in transactions | Changes made by **transactions** are atomic, either the transaction is successful and all changes are applied, or the transaction fails and no changes are applied. Any exceptions thrown from a transaction processor function will cause the entire **transaction** to be rolled back, leaving no changes to the blockchain or world state. So nothing is persisted if a transaction fails, Composer throw an exception and the transaction gets rolled back by Fabric. https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/reference/js_scripts.html
|Can a Composer transaction call another Transaction? |No - a transaction cannot presently be called from another transaction. In Hyperledger Fabric (which Hyperledger Composer is currently using), you are not able to read your own writes from within a transaction, meaning that you cannot add something to a registry in your TP and then read it, in the same transaction. However, a transaction processor can call other functions to allow for code modularisation, but it will only be registered as a single transaction request, in the transaction registry. 
| Calling a TP **function** from another | see example below - two parts
| (1) Calling from main script file - sample callout from `script.js`: | `var returnVal;     //And now call the function in func2.js var returnVal= sayHello("Jon Doe"); 		 var code = returnVal.code; var msg= returnVal.message; console.log('The returned message and code are: Msg-> ' + msg + ' the code -> ' + code );` // output is "The returned message and code are: Msg -> Hello Jon Doe the code -> 11"
| (2) Called function - defined in file `func2.js` |  `function sayHello(name) { retMsg = "hello " + name; return {code: 11, message: retMsg}; }` 
|Catching errors in a JS TP function | sample code is shown (make sure to return a Promise) `return bizNetworkConnection.submitTransaction(transaction).then((result) => {             console.log("Tx Result", result) ; }).catch((exception) => { console.log("error", exception);` })
| Calling out of TPF using `post(url, resource)` and setting headers | here's an example here -> https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/integrating/call-out.html   application/json headers not yet supported in post -> see example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43209924/rest-api-use-the-accept-application-json-http-header - issue raised for this -> https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/issues/3071
| Do I really need to model transactions? | there are the generic system transaction types (eg adding a new asset is `AddAsset` or AddParticipant or IssueIdentity etc etc) and there are your modeled transaction classes (that you refer to) like `SettleTrade` or `IssueTicket` or `PayVendor` etc etc . You can try out sample models (such as shown here https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-sample-networks/tree/master/packages/trade-network) under the 'sample-networks repo there is a 'model' directory in each business network sample you can look at. But if you want to (or your business processes dictate) update assets or participants in your business network, you would need to define a transaction of sorts (it defines the parameters of change (eg. change of owner, adding a deposit to a bank account etc etc), with which to update a target asset or participant registry). Unless of course you were just adding assets or participants only each time (create asset, create participants) and not require a specific transaction class to update them later (ie one-off record instance, for queries only etc) - see the intro here for more info -> https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/introduction/introduction

Composer v0.18 (current @next release or older 0.17.x with alpha) works only with H/Fabric v1.1-rc1 (docker images), so you will need to pull those docker containers (fyi this is part of the Composer tools dev setup for "@next" environments). To work with v0.18.x environments (pulling the composer '@next' tagged modules) and to clear up v0.16.x environments - these steps should help: 1)	Make backups (eg to JSON text files etc) copies of your model, acl, queries, transaction js etc. If you have exported your Network BNA file, then all the better 2)	Remove your 'old' Fabric (v1.0.x) docker images with the Fabric-tools script teardownFabric.sh 3) 	uninstall existing composer code `npm uninstall -g composer-cli` (repeat for composer-rest-server and composer-playground as necessary) 4)	Remove the 'old' business network cards folder eg. rm -rf ~/.composer - again this is to removed old dev cards - be careful to save any `connection.json` metadata you created (if need be) for 0.16.x multi-machine environments that you've built - DO NOTE HOWEVER that the connection profile format in v0.18.x is different to v0.16.x (but you can merge in your v0.16.x profile sections to conform to 0.18.x) see here for 0.18.x (and indeed same as older 0.17.x) format -> https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/next/reference/connectionprofile.html  5)	Stop (using docker stop) and remove your old deployed 'chaincode' business network containers (ie v0.16.x) 6) export FABRIC_VERSION=hlfv11     7) Follow the instructions for 'next' install here https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/next/installing/development-tools.html  8) With new Fabric v1.1 RC1 up and running, deploy the current composer runtime to the peers and do a network start of your BNA on the channel configured in your connection profile. 9. recreate any business network cards as before, with the new connection profile format, import and test - for the business network in question 10. reconstitute any test data you have / had via Node-red JSON import etc or use Composer Playground.

| Controlling authority to update a B N | this is a change management issue (a business network model and definition and a policy for aggregating signatures or authority to be able to update a business network using `composer network update`) . By the time it gets to `composer network update` it seems, its already too late. The Network ACLs in Composer, can restrict who (ie a participant of that network) was allowed to do the network update. Its possible that such a record is only created once all the signatures are collected, as a one-time operation (so that the network update could take place).
